// Given a grid of cells where each cell can have one of three values:
// - 0 representing an empty cell,
// - 1 representing a fresh tomato, or
// - 2 representing a rotten tomato.

// Every minute, any fresh tomato that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten tomato becomes rotten.

// Write a function that returns the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh tomato. If this is impossible, return -1.

// Function Signature:
// int minTimeToRotAllTomatoes(vector<vector<int>>& grid);
